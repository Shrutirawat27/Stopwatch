A simple Python application that functions as a countdown timer and stopwatch using Tkinter. The app provides a clean interface to start, stop, reset a countdown, and also run a stopwatch with start, stop, and resume functionality.

## Features

- Stopwatch with start, stop, and resume functionality
- Alerts user when countdown reaches zero
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter
- Background image for a visually appealing interface

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Make sure Python 3 and PIL (Pillow) library are installed:  
   `pip install pillow`  
3. Run the application:  
   `python script.py`  
4. Enter hours, minutes, and seconds for countdown timer and click "Start Countdown"  
5. Use the "Stop" and "Reset" buttons to control the countdown  
6. Use "Start Stopwatch", "Stop Stopwatch", and "Resume Stopwatch" buttons to control the stopwatch

## What I Learned
- Creating GUI applications using Python Tkinter  
- Handling images in Python using Pillow (PIL)  
- Implementing countdown logic and stopwatch functionality  
- Updating GUI dynamically using `root.after` and `time.sleep`  
- Managing state variables for running and paused timers
